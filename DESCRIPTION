Description: An implementation of the Adaptive Neyman test (TAN) for identifying differential histone modifications 
    from ChIP-seq data. It is a nonparametric method for qualitative comparison of ChIP-seq data. We demonstrate that 
    this framework can detect differential histone enrichment under a wide range of settings. Compared to existing methods, 
    TAN shows a much better performance to detect subtle differences in coverage levels between samples, yet is capable of 
    detecting higher order changes such as shape across pre-defined regions. Additionally, not only can TAN be universally applicable 
    to any type of ChIP-seq data, but also easily extended for multiple condition comparison.
